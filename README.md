Calcutip is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: He Zhang

Time spent: 7 hours spent in total

## User Stories
![Calcutip Demo gif] (Calcutip Demo.gif)

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Custom font
* [x] UI animations
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:
- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
      * User can adjust party number to get the calculation of total per person.

What I **didn't do**:
- [ ] I didn't take advantage of the extra screenspace when keyboard is dismissed.
- [ ] I could have do a better job in the animation transition. Or have the UIStepper appear later when the user needs it.


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Different syntat from the tutorial and Swift3.
- Understand how calculation works when adding the UIStepper. The total amont has to be devided by an integer.
- Where to put function and setup code.
